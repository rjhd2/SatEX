# SatEX
Mainly python codes that were produced during a 10 week summer placement at the UK Met Office by Veronika Pörtge.
The topic of the project is LST-derived climate extreme indices.
It has three main parts:
* [Data Preparation](data_preparation)
* [Analysis of the average LST value and its coverage](average_LST_and_coverage)
* [Climate Index Calculation and Analysis](climate_index_calculation)

There is also a code for analysing [HadEX2 and ECA&D data](other_datasets_eca_d_hadex).
Furthermore several [bash scripts](other_codes) were used for handling the data.
